# 🌍 Procedural Terrain Generation 🏞️

Welcome to my exciting procedural terrain generation project! This project brings the beauty of nature, space, and spaceX to your screen using custom shaders using GLSL and Three.js.

## Introduction 🌟

Procedural terrain generation involves creating terrain algorithmically rather than manually designing it. This project explores different methods to achieve realistic and varied terrain generation. Dive in and explore the virtual landscapes! 🌄

## Features ✨

- 🌱 Generation of terrain using Perlin noise
- 🌊 Implementation of erosion algorithms for realistic terrain features
- 🎨 Custom shaders for stunning visuals
- 🕹️ Interactive GUI for terrain customization
- 💡 Realistic lighting and shadows

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- 💻 JavaScript
- 🎮 Three.js
- 🎨 CustomShaderMaterial
- 🖼️ lil-gui
- 🗺️ RGBELoader, FontLoader, TextureLoader
- 📜 GLSL shaders

## Getting Started 🚀

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/procedural-terrain.git
cd procedural-terrain
```
2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run your development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage 🖥️

After setting up, you can customize and explore the terrain using the provided GUI. Adjust frequencies, strengths, colors, and more to see how the terrain evolves in real-time! 🌐

Enjoy creating stunning terrains! 🌍✨
