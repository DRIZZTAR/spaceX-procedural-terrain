## Introduction 🌟

Procedural terrain generation involves creating terrain algorithmically rather than manually designing it. This project explores different methods to achieve realistic and varied terrain generation. Dive in and explore the virtual landscapes! 🌄

## Features ✨

- 🌱 Generation of terrain using Perlin noise
- 🌊 Implementation of erosion algorithms for realistic terrain features
- 🎨 Custom shaders for stunning visuals
- 🕹️ Interactive GUI for terrain customization
- 💡 Realistic lighting and shadows

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- 💻 JavaScript
- 🎮 Three.js
- 🎨 CustomShaderMaterial
- 🖼️ lil-gui
- 🗺️ RGBELoader, FontLoader, TextureLoader
- 📜 GLSL shaders

## Getting Started 🚀

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/procedural-terrain.git
cd procedural-terrain
```
2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run your development server
